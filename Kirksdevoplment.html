          <p>What a beautiful red. Your eyes shine like a burning sun filled with anger and malice, and yet they are eclipsed by a moon of sorrow and grief. And what's left is a Bloodmoon, casting its crimson hue over all that your eyes gaze upon. And "HE" can’t wait to watch it all turn to blood.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>There are moments when the moon in your eyes pulls back and reveals the burning nova in your soul. Its rage penetrating. And it’s moments like those, when I get a good look, that I remember how my Captain’s eyes burned the same color.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Valen, I have to say, I’m jealous of you. I can only manifest those eyes for a minute or so in one form. And yet you manifest it so effortlessly that you caught his attention. Slaughter.</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>And you can’t blame me for wondering if I took your eyes would I see the same dark thing.</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Your eyes seem a faint white light, so pale and alone. You abandoned your nation, your sister, your lover, and all your friends and wonder why you feel so alone. Perhaps your eyes were given in pairs, so you wouldn’t feel so isolated when you stare at the world you left behind.</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>I have an announcement I would like to make. First of all, I have come to the conclusion that I am unwell. I thought you all had a strange sense of humour for telling me off. But I finally have met with a Doctor, and I realize I am unwell. I’m not sure what it means, but I would like to formally introduce Doctor Therovin Whole. He shall be joining this little party and shall be of great help to me. I also recommend that you set off to seek his guidance too, perhaps he could even heal the rift between you two sisters. But enough about me. Doctor, please present yourself.</p>

          <p>Stop. Can’t you see that I’m still hungry?</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>What I bring to the world is commanded me by my Captain. When I help people scream and shiver it’s only allowing them to be freed of fear. People suffer more from fear than the actual effects, dear. For example, you fear and feel more pain and hurt from the idea and worry of losing your sister than you would feel for actually seeing her die. Like a sick infected arm, the longer you nurse your cares and dread losing them, you keep an infested arm allowing the infection to spread to the body. If you simply cut the arm or perhaps bleed it, then you would be fine and save the whole. When I bleed people of their fears, it gives them a chance to overcome it, and will teach them what a true horror is. Horror is no longer fear, but the embodiment of pain.</p>

          <p>If you still have something you love, or haven’t suffered, you still are afraid of losing and experiencing it.</p>

          <p>Emris, can’t you tell your sister is making you vulnerable? She’s filling you with fear and poisoning your life. She’ll invite him into your presence if you’re not careful, she’s untrained in the manifesting of her form. And yet I imagine in not too long she will call to the sun, and beckon it come closer and closer, until that great tree catches fire, and this whole nation burns from its leaves to its roots.</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>My Claire told me of the stars, and how they were a ladder to another world. She told me there was a star close by and if I worked hard enough I could jump to it, and then to others, climbing the heavens and working towards a new world. Do you think she was telling the truth?</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>She’s gotten a taste for blood now, and she will drink it by the bucket.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Emris, this might be hard to understand, yet you left your sister once. Do you think I could go back and help my family then, like you?</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Emris, I feel like people are lying to me, and I don’t know who I can trust anymore.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Doctor, you mention that I have abandoned my family, and a man at a well said the same thing. I thought it was just them blabbering nonsense, but I have to ask, do I have a family? Do you think my family thinks I left them? Whatever happened I’m positive that I was carried away, or perhaps I was forced out to save their life. I wonder what kind of faces they will make when they see I have finally come home. I bet my daughter will rush to my arms and cry with joy. I wonder if the heavens will shed golden tears to celebrate my return.</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>The Doctor helped me. I don’t feel so alone anymore, and yet when he leaves, it’s crippling.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Emris, I know we’re not on good terms right now. However, I have reason to believe your compatriot is entirely unwell. I told the doctor about her branding and the effects and he was most concerned. But before we go any further, he was also concerned for you, Emris. And as instruction, I have to ask: “What is it that you fear most?” I think what you fear most is losing her to that infernal revolutionary that hides within her skin. And that she will slaughter the nation you love while hiding in your arms, using your body as a shield to break the oncoming wave of arrows that will one day find its mark.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>But now that your fear has been spotted, Emris, we will watch it, nurture it, and do everything in our power to make sure that her desire to free her nation never grows taller than the walls, and her need of you that encase her to you for a sense of family.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Right now she’s broken a fire with little branches. Should she have something more worth fighting for, it will be logs on the fire, and it will burn and consume you, and you will fuel her slaughter on the people.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>A part of me wants to unleash her inner demon and quench her gaping thirst for the blood of Demori, so much that she will drink the life out of that great tree. And yet, another part wants her to fight it, and be happy with you, free from that fiend within.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>You wish to have your nation freed and your compatriot happy, but the girl you quest after has a dark heart, and it will continue to rot, along with the bodies that she puts in the streets.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>Your grief runs so deeply you almost can’t feel fear, can you? You’re so filled with sorrow it’s a wonder you can carry anything else within you at all. It makes sense why "HE" likes—</p>
        </article>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>I remember now. I had a wife. Her name was Claire. She was a healer and worked with me at a hospital. We helped so many people there. A soldier? I was never a soldier. I grew up in the town, met Claire, started the hospital and then… oh no… and then what? Oh my poor Claire, she must be waiting for me to come home. I must come home and find her. Quickly now, we ride home.</p>
